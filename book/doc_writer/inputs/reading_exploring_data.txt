okay so I created a new Google collab uh
00:07:55.500
jupyter notebook here and this will
00:07:57.780
allow me to later easily share this code
00:07:59.639
that we're going to develop together
00:08:00.720
with you so you can follow along so this
00:08:03.120
will be in the video description later
00:08:05.060
now here I've just done some
00:08:07.620
preliminaries I downloaded the data set
00:08:09.720
the tiny Shakespeare data set at this
00:08:11.220
URL and you can see that it's about a
00:08:12.960
one megabyte file
00:08:14.639
then here I open the input.txt file and
00:08:17.460
just read in all the text as a string
00:08:19.379
and we see that we are working with 1
00:08:21.360
million characters roughly
00:08:23.400
and the first 1000 characters if we just
00:08:25.319
print them out are basically what you
00:08:27.060
would expect this is the first 1000
00:08:28.919
characters of the tiny Shakespeare data
00:08:31.259
set roughly up to here
00:08:33.659
so so far so good next we're going to
00:08:36.120
take this text and the text is a
00:08:38.580
sequence of characters in Python so when
00:08:40.620
I call the set Constructor on it I'm
00:08:43.080
just going to get the set of all the
00:08:45.660
characters that occur in this text
00:08:48.180
and then I call list on that to create a
00:08:51.480
list of those characters instead of just
00:08:52.800
a set so that I have an ordering an
00:08:54.600
arbitrary ordering
00:08:56.160
and then I sort that
00:08:58.200
so basically we get just all the
00:08:59.820
characters that occur in the entire data
00:09:01.440
set and they're sorted now the number of
00:09:03.660
them is going to be our vocabulary size
00:09:05.399
these are the possible elements of our
00:09:07.800
sequences and we see that when I print
00:09:10.080
here the characters
00:09:12.120
there's 65 of them in total there's a
00:09:14.820
space character and then all kinds of
00:09:16.560
special characters
00:09:18.120
and then capitals and lowercase letters
00:09:21.180
so that's our vocabulary and that's the
00:09:23.100
sort of like possible characters that
00:09:25.740
the model can see or emit
