## Reading and Processing Text Data in Rust

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of reading a text file, extracting unique characters, and sorting them to determine our vocabulary size using Rust. This is particularly useful in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text generation where understanding the set of unique characters in a dataset is essential.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Before diving into the code, ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. If it's not installed, you can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

You will also need to include the `candle` crate (a library for tensor-based computing) in your `Cargo.toml` file.

### Step 2: Reading and Processing the Data

Below is the Rust code that reads a text file (`input.txt`), extracts all unique characters, sorts them, and prints them along with the vocabulary size.

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

fn main() {
    // Read the file into a string
    let file_path = "input.txt";
    let file_content = fs::read_to_string(file_path).expect("Unable to read file");

    // Create a BTreeSet to store unique characters in sorted order
    let mut unique_chars = BTreeSet::new();
    for char in file_content.chars() {
        unique_chars.insert(char);
    }

    // Print out the sorted unique characters
    println!("Unique characters in the text:");
    for char in &unique_chars {
        print!("{}", char);
    }

    // Print the vocabulary size
    let vocab_size = unique_chars.len();
    println!("\nVocabulary size: {}", vocab_size);
}
```

### Step 3: Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Rust project:
   ```sh
   cargo new text_processing
   cd text_processing
   ```

2. Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the code above.

3. Create an `input.txt` file in the root of your project directory and paste your text data into it.

4. Run the project:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

### Explanation

#### Reading the File

We use the `fs::read_to_string` function to read the entire file content into a string.

```rust
let file_content = fs::read_to_string(file_path).expect("Unable to read file");
```

#### Extracting and Sorting Unique Characters

We utilize a `BTreeSet` to store unique characters in a sorted order automatically. The `chars()` method splits the string into an iterator of characters which we then insert into the `BTreeSet`.

```rust
let mut unique_chars = BTreeSet::new();
for char in file_content.chars() {
    unique_chars.insert(char);
}
```

#### Printing Results

Finally, we print the unique characters and calculate the vocabulary size by getting the length of the `BTreeSet`.

```rust
for char in &unique_chars {
    print!("{}", char);
}

let vocab_size = unique_chars.len();
println!("\nVocabulary size: {}", vocab_size);
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to process text data to find and sort unique characters using Rust. This foundational step is crucial in preparing data for various NLP tasks such as text generation models. Ensure to understand each part of the code and try extending it to handle different text preprocessing tasks as you get more comfortable with Rust.
